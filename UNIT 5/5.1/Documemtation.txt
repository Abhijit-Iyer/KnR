									K&R EXERCISE 5.1

							------------OBJECTIVE--------------

 To create a function getint(int *), that would read integer characters from the console and store them in a specific memory address. In the framework given in the book, any non integer present after a sign is treated as zero. We had to manipulate that and the manipulation is done. 

 							-----------------------------------

							----------METHODS PRESENT----------

=> main();
			
=> getint(int *);
			
			The function getint(int *) reads a character/series of characters from the console, converts them into an integer(if valid) and stores them in the memory address passed by the caller.
